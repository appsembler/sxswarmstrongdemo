This was something a Libertarian candidate could not accomplish during the 2008 primary, when \"uncommitted\" won a plurality.</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=File:2012MOlibprimary.PNG&amp;filetimestamp=20120302013843\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/2012MOlibprimary.PNG/220px-2012MOlibprimary.PNG\" width=\"220\" height=\"194\" class=\"thumbimage\"/></a>\n<div class=\"thumbcaption\">\n<div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=File:2012MOlibprimary.PNG&amp;filetimestamp=20120302013843\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"><img src=\"//bits.wikimedia.org/skins-1.19/common/images/magnify-clip.png\" width=\"15\" height=\"11\" alt=\"\"/></a></div>\n<p style=\"margin:0px;font-size:90%\"><span style=\"border:1px #AAAAAA solid;background-color:Lime;color:Lime;\">\u2588\u2588</span>\u00a0James Ogle</p>\n<p style=\"margin:0px;font-size:90%\"><span style=\"border:1px #AAAAAA solid;background-color:Silver;color:Silver;\">\u2588\u2588</span>\u00a0Uncommitted</p>\n<br/><span style=\"font-size:90%\" class=\"plainlinks\">Image: <a href=\"//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:William_S._Saturn\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"commons:User:William S.

It is known as the USA Parliament. Ogle believes his username for the project \u2014 Joogle, a combination of his surname and first and middle initials \u2014 served as a basis for the name of the search engine <span class=\"interwiki-link-local\"><a href=\"/wiki/Google\" title=\"Google\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Google</a></span>; for his campaign, he uses the slogan \"Go Ogle\".</p>\n<p>To appear on the Missouri ballot, Ogle paid a filing fee of $1000. He was the only Libertarian candidate to do so. Ogle thinks this happened because he is \"accessible\" in comparison to his opponents, \"perhaps the other candidates couldn't be reached, and since there was about a 48 hour deadline to file the papers, they either didn't want to spend the $30 on overnight postage, they simply didn't know or else they didn't want to file.\" Other candidates for the Libertarian Party nomination, who missed the ballot, include former <a href=\"/wiki/New_Mexico\" title=\"New Mexico\" class=\"mw-redirect\">New Mexico</a> <span class=\"interwiki-link-foreign\"><a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_Mexico\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Governor of New Mexico\">governor</a></span> <span class=\"interwiki-link-foreign\"><a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Johnson\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Gary Johnson\">Gary Johnson</a></span>, former air traffic controller <span class=\"interwiki-link-foreign\"><a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RJ_Harris\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:RJ Harris\">RJ Harris</a></span>, and activist <span class=\"interwiki-link-foreign\"><a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Lee_Wrights\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:R.

In the story, he \"was able to explain about ranked choice voting, the Libertarian's philosophy of the non initiation of force, smaller government and more liberty.\" In addition, the report mentioned Ogle's desire to be the running mate of Green Party presidential candidate Roseanne Barr.</p>\n<p>According to Ogle: \"the combination of all these events, somehow could have prompted more to ask for the Libertarian ballot when they went to the voting booth.\"</p>\n<p>The non-binding primary is the only contest the Libertarian Party will hold before its nominating convention in May. California is also to hold a primary, but it is scheduled after the nomination. Ogle is to appear on the California ballot.</p>\n<h2>Republican focuses on Iran</h2><p>Republican presidential candidate Hugh Cort, a psychiatrist and President of the non-profit American Foundation for Counter-Terrorism Policy and Research, describes his campaign's status as \"wait-and-see\". In December, he participated in the Republican Party's lesser-known candidates forum, and was included on the <span class=\"interwiki-link-foreign\"><a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire_Republican_primary,_2012\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:New Hampshire Republican primary, 2012\">New Hampshire Republican primary</a></span> ballot. He received a total of three votes.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Cort's main area of concern is the <span class=\"interwiki-link-foreign\"><a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Nuclear program of Iran\">nuclear situation</a></span> in <a href=\"/wiki/Iran\" title=\"Iran\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Iran</a>, which garnered significant press in February.

However, Roy contacted Hannah via telephone. Having travelled to the scene of the attack, Hannah told the court: \"Craig had blood all over him. I was worried he was hurt. He wasn't saying anything. He wasn't making sense. He looked bewildered. There was a knife in his hand.\" He stated of Frew: \"His neck was cut. It was open.

The series results have implications for the squad composition; of the seventeen players brought into the Australian training camp running this test series, only thirteen of them can expect an opportunity to travel to London to compete in the Olympics.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAustralia dominated the series with precision passing from the team&#39;s goalkeepers who enabled the game to quickly move down the pool, and the ability of the team&#39;s goal scorers to get the ball on target. In contrast, through out the series, the UK lacked a quality long passing game and instead relied on short passes from the perimeter of play where they were faced with less one-on-one coverage. The last game of the series also saw several turn overs and poor shooting on the part of the UK, with many shots going above or to the side of the net, or the shot clock running out.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAustralia won all of the games of the test series, with scores of 13&ndash;5 in the first test last Tuesday, 14&ndash;4 in the second test last Thursday, 15&ndash;6 in the third test on Saturday, 14&ndash;8 in the fourth test yesterday (Monday) and 14&ndash;3 in the last test match today.

America needs to rethink its military posture to reflect the its true requirements over the next decade and stop fighting the wars of the 19th century.

Amanda Nolan, 21-year-old college <span class=\"interwiki-link-foreign\"><a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Student\">student</a></span>, says retailers can expand their markets with this type of competition.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think they should try to compete because many people cannot afford the expensive products offered by Apple,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cBy offering a cheaper priced e-reader that has similar features as the iPad, the retailers could expand their market to a wider consumer audience.\u201d</p>\n<p>With the Nook and Kindle tablets both becoming more technologically efficient, some say the two may give Apple a run for its money. Bill Richardson, 56-year-old <span class=\"interwiki-link-foreign\"><a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Engineer\">engineer</a></span>, says the size and features of his Kindle are enough to keep him satisfied.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Kindle can access its book store virtually anywhere and its size allows me to easily carry it around from place to place,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIf something happened to my Kindle, I would consider replacing it with an iPad, but the iPad is larger and may be awkward to use in my setting.\u201d</p>\n<p>The <span class=\"interwiki-link-foreign\"><a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Los Angeles Times\">Los Angeles Times</a></span> reports Barnes and Noble sales increased 64 percent during the <span class=\"interwiki-link-foreign\"><a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_year\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Calendar year\">third quarter</a></span>, as compared to this same time the previous year.

This past year alone, <span class=\"interwiki-link-foreign\"><a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Pew Research Center\">pewinternet.org</a></span> reports sales increased 19 percent among citizens ages 30-49. This type of sales increases is causing some consumers to say <span class=\"interwiki-link-foreign\"><a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-book_reader\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:E-book reader\">e-readers</a></span> are here for good and make a worthwhile investment.</p>\n<p>Consumers like Richardson say the convenience factor helps keep e-readers around. \u201cI think e-readers are here to stay,\u201d Richardson says. \u201cTheir readability, convenience, and access to many books, magazines, newspapers, etc. make them very appealing to users.\u201d</p>\n<p>Consumers like Nolan say e-readers are here to stay due to the technological need. \u201cI think they are definitely here to stay,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cTechnology has become an extension of our everyday lives and inventions like the e-reader makes things much easier for us.\u201d</p>\n<p><br style=\"clear:none;\"/></p>",

Grant Patterson, Brett Stibners, Adam Deans, Kim Robins, Mitchell Pink and Jessica Gallagher are a few of Australia's 2012 Paralympic hopefuls.</p>\n<p>Disability swimmer Grant Patterson is hoping to qualify for the Games in the 150m medley at the Australian Swimming Championships on March 15 in Adelaide. Patterson told The Cairns Post, \"I'm basically training my butt off. Sunday is the only day that I'm having off at the moment.\" Late last month in the Atherton Tablelands town of Mareeba, he participated in a Guinness World Record breaking attempt at the most people swimming 100m in a one-hour period of 2533 people. The Tableland group believes they broke record with 5182 swimmers and are awaiting confirmation from the Guinness World Record judges.</p>\n<p>Members of <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_men%27s_national_wheelchair_basketball_team\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Australia men's national wheelchair basketball team\">Australian Rollers</a> started their <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Wheelchair_Basketball_League\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:National Wheelchair Basketball League\">domestic basketball</a> season late last month. Brett Stibners played in his team's season opener for Wollongong Roller Hawks against the Dandenong side. Western Australians Adam Deans and Kim Robins have been training up to twenty-five hours a week in an effort to step up their game. They are hoping to leverage their domestic performance with the Perth Wheelcats into a final spot with the national team, with final selection for London being determined in May. Australia is going into the Paralympic Games ranked number one in the world.</p>\n<p>100m sprinter and long jumper Mitchell Pink has been competing around Australia to improve his time and distance in order to qualify for London. In late February, the <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T38_(classification)\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:T38 (classification)\">T38</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Category:Athletics\" title=\"Category:Athletics\">athletics</a> competitor with cerebral palsy competed at the Melbourne Classics for Athletes With Disability. In late March, he competes at the 2012 NSW Track and Field AWD Championship and in April he competes at the Australian National Open and Athletes With Disability Championships with the goal of gaining the attention of Athletics Australia's selectors who are looking for a time of 14.10 in the 100m and distance of 5.93m in the long jump. His personal best in the event is 12.77.</p>\n<p>Winter Paralympic bronze medalist <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Gallagher\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:Jessica Gallagher\">Jessica Gallagher</a> also competed at the Melbourne Classics for Athletes With Disability with the goal of catching the attention of Paralympic selectors for the long jump. The minimum qualifying distance for an <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T13_(classification)\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"w:T13 (classification)\">F13</a> visually impaired woman is 5.15m. She won came in first in Melbourne with a distance of 5.27m but needs to be able to jump around 6m to have a serious chance of winning a gold in London. With a javelin throw distance of 37.31m which earned her a third place finish, she easily met the minimum qualifying distance of 29.95m. Of her performance in Melbourne, she told the Geelong Advertiser, \"I've worked really hard to get to qualification standard and now the focus is on London. Everything is tailored towards peaking at London. I'm still in heavy training, so to jump that far tonight in tough conditions was pleasing, especially with the knowledge I'm still tired from all the weights I've been doing. The goal is to lighten the load and then peak at London.\"</p>\n<p><br style=\"clear:none;\"/></p>",

Recently, the organisation has embarked on a program of measured growth and inclusion which will afford many more schools and communities access to the opportunities that it initiates. Schools are expected to attend an annual international conference hosted by a member school. The conference is a forum to experience cultural differences, create global friendships and to be addressed by relevant and influential speakers. Such conferences generate opportunities for debate and personal exploration and are life changing experiences.</p>\n<p>Round Square has its foundation in the theories of the experiential educational philosopher Kurt Hahn who believed that schools should have a greater purpose beyond preparing young people for College and University. Hahn believed that it was crucial for students to prepare for life by having them face it head on and experience it in ways that would demand courage, generosity, imagination, principle and resolution. As a result, he felt that young people would become empowered and develop the skills and abilities to be the leaders and guardians of tomorrow's world. He believed that given the appropriate set of circumstances and the correct attitude, young men and women could discovery their own inner strength and an understanding of the physical and social world around them. Currently there are more than eighty global member schools, and twenty regional member schools worldwide who actively subscribe to Hahn\u2019s philosophy. Estimated demographic data would reflect a student capacity of in the region of 50 000 and a teacher/management workforce force of about 5000 plus. Member schools believe that the pillars of Hahn\u2019s insight are the ideals on which our future is built. These broad fundamentals cover a wide spectrum of social, political and economic environments and are:</p>\n<pre>\n   An international understanding and tolerance of others,\n</pre>\n<pre>\n   Democratic governance and justice,\n</pre>\n<pre>\n   Environmental stewardship,\n</pre>\n<pre>\n   Self discovery through adventure,\n</pre>\n<pre>\n   Leadership and\n</pre>\n<pre>\n   Service to others.\n</pre>\n<p>Adityajit Singh Kang, a Scholar Blazer holder had earlier participated in first International Conference for Schools hosted by Eden Project, Cornwall, UK from 11 October 2011 to 14 October 2011 on Sustainable Future - Global is Green.</p>\n<p><br style=\"clear:none;\"/></p>",

His wife suffers from a medical condition called Paroxysmal Supra-Ventricular Tachycardia (PSVT), Factor V Leiden and Fibromyalgia (along with a few other undiagnosed issues). Though Factor V Leiden &amp; PSVT are not always complicated issues, Mrs. Riley was under supervision of a cardiologist because of several episodes of PSVT and fairly rare issues associated with the two. Sgt. Riley and his wife have known of these issues for a while, and were both well aware of the effects that they could have on Mrs. Riley\u2019s pregnancy, and were confident that things would go well while Sgt. Riley was away. \n</pre>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Early in the deployment, Sgt. Riley had, had two separate encounters between him and the chain of command. The first was because Sgt. Riley voiced concerned that soldiers in his squad were pulling guard shifts with weapons that contained NO AMMUNITION, and he was concerned with the safety of his squad. He wrote home to his wife asking her to try and inform others of the issue as well. The second issue that came to light, was that the Lieutenant directly above Sgt. Riley was ordering soldiers in the Company to keep wildlife (camel spiders) in their barracks rooms as \u201cmascots\u201d for the company, not only is this illegal, but Sgt. Riley saw this as a form of hazing, and inappropriate, and he also reported the same Lieutenant for using \u201cgang chants\u201d as cadences.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>When Sgt. Riley\u2019s wife was 28 weeks pregnant, she ended up hospitalized in the Cardiac Unit at Cape Fear Valley Medical Center in Fayetteville NC. Her husband received a Red Cross message in Iraq to inform him that his pregnant wife had gone into PSVT and needed him home. The Physician\u2019s Assistant assigned to the company that Sgt. Riley was in made multiple attempts to reach Mrs. Riley in the hospital and when he could not reach her (because the line kept dropping) he proceeded to call the hospital staff, inform him that he was Sgt. Riley and illegally obtain Mrs. Riley\u2019s medical records over the phone.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>With the minimal information provided to him, he than made a decision not to send Sgt. Riley home to assist his wife.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Sgt. Riley\u2019s wife was having a very difficult time with her pregnancy at home, and living alone, terrified that something may happen to her or her unborn child, so she began to push to have her husband home. She also made it clear to the chain of command directly above Sgt. Riley, that she wanted the Physician\u2019s Assistant assigned to their company held accountable for illegally obtaining medical information. She made threats toward the chain of command to take the issue to her Congressman and the Inspector General at the 82nd Airborne Division.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>After she proceeded to attempt to bring the issue to the attention of the chain of command, the Lieutenant directly above Sgt. Riley, pulled him aside and informed him that he would ruin Sgt. Riley\u2019s career if he did not keep his wife from reporting the Physician\u2019s Assistant, as they \u201cwere boys\u201d, and he informed him that he would handle it.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Despite the threat, Mrs. Riley pursued the complaint anyways, and following her hospital stay, the Family Readiness Group leader contacted Mrs. Riley a week after she returned home from the hospital, claiming she was offering her assistance. Mrs. Riley expressed to her that she felt it almost a slap in the face that the woman had waited a full week to contact her, and declined her assistance, and the FRG leader (also the spouse of Sgt. Riley\u2019s Company Commander) made it very clear that Sgt. Riley was not going to be returning home to assist Mrs. Riley. Needless to say, the phone call did not end well. Following the altercation over the phone, Mrs. Riley and The FRG Leader, had a very public argument over the FRG\u2019s Facebook Page (that has since been taken down by the Company Commander\u2014But Mrs. Riley has more than enough copies to go around). In this altercation, the two went back and forth until ultimately, the FRG Leader threatened Sgt. Riley\u2019s pregnant wife.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>In the months following, Sgt. Riley wrote home explaining to his wife, a chain of command that was treating him differently. He explained that he was being constantly disrespected, spoken down to and threatened by those individuals directly over him. Eventually, Sgt. Riley was removed from his position as a squad leader (which he held at the rank of E5---it is unclear whether he made the decision to step down as he felt was necessary, or was asked to step down).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Shortly following his loss of position, Sgt. Riley was then detained by his chain of command on \u201csuicide watch\u201d, despite having any reason to do so, or any medical evaluation that would make this okay, his weapon was taken, and he was detained in his deployed barracks. During this period, the chain of command would not provide Sgt. Riley with access to a lawyer or the Inspector General, and the chain of command made multiple attempts to illegally question Sgt, Riley, implicating that he had committed some illegal act.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>After a medical examination of Sgt. Riley, it was determined that he was not suicidal, and the chain of command was then instructed to remove him from suicide watch.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>During the time in which Sgt. Riley was being detained on suicide watch, Sgt. Riley\u2019s father-in-law (who is a retired Special Forces LTC. And works in Washington D.C. currently) Wrote an email to the Commanding Officer of his Battalion, asking why he was being detained without a lawyer, and pleading with him to look at the entire situation and determine if Sgt. Riley\u2019s rights were being violated\u2014also pointing out the issues with Sgt. Riley and the chain of command. He received a response indicating loosely that he would look into it. During the same time frame, Sgt. Riley\u2019s wife also filed a complaint with the Inspector General of the 82nd Airborne Division indicating the issues with the chain of command, the altercation between her and the FRG leader etc. (which was ignored, and never addressed any further) and also made multiple attempts to contact their Congressman, but was told that he could not do anything without a signed statement from Sgt. Riley (who was being illegally detained and unable to provide one).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Following the email, on August 24th 2011, Sgt. Riley was charged with \u201cassault with a deadly weapon\u201d, but not immediately given a lawyer, a reason, explanation etc.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>A second email was then sent the Commanding Officer, to further inform him of the issues between Sgt. Riley and the chain of command, and to point out inappropriate photos that were being displayed online by the Lieutenant who had previously threatened Sgt. Riley. He received no response.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>In the days following the second email, the Lieutenant wrote a sworn statement implying that Sgt. Riley was mentally unstable, along with several other statements indicating that he suffered from PTSD, or was mentally unsound. ---These were not made by anyone with any form of medical background, and were deemed inadmissible in court.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>On September 23rd 2011, Mrs. Riley gave birth to their son, Noah, early in the morning. From the time Mrs. Riley was 28 weeks pregnant until the birth of their son, she was in the hospital 17 separate times. Sgt. Riley was not present for his son\u2019s birth; instead, he was in Iraq, being treated as an already convicted criminal (however he was still carrying around his weapon---make note of this as you read on).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Sgt. Riley was sent a Red Cross message indicating that his son had been born and received only a balled up piece of torn paper with their son\u2019s height and weight scrambled onto it, thrown at him. The chain of command called the Red Cross themselves to confirm that Sgt. Riley had received it (its procedure for the soldier to call).</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>At roughly 5pm that evening, Mrs. Riley went into PSVT in her hospital room. Rapid Response was called. Upon being unable to slow down Mrs. Riley\u2019s heart rate, (which was over 250bpm) she was chemically shocked. This failed, and the dosage was double and she was chemically shocked a second time. The second time, it was successful, and Mrs. Riley was moved back to the cardiac unit without her newborn son, because he could not be on the floor as it was not secured for newborns (the hospital ultimately made accommodations to have an armed guard outside her hospital room so that she could keep her newborn in the room with her). Sgt. Riley was sent another Red Cross message that was never given to him by his chain of command.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The following day, an unprepared Sgt. Riley walked into his Article 32 hearing, completely unprepared, and having spent only 20-30 minutes face to face with his lawyer directly prior to the hearing (this was not his lawyers fault, as he was assigned to the case, and had been elsewhere). It was recommended that the charges go to General Court Marshall.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>When Noah was approx. three weeks old, Sgt. Riley was sent home from Iraq, not to meet his son, but to face a General Court Marshall.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>From the time Sgt. Riley returned home, until the exact day their son turned four months old Sgt. Riley worked his normal hours, and stayed at home with his wife and son. He never experienced issues with the chain of command during this time (his direct chain of command did not return from Iraq until more recently). When his chain of command did begin to return home, Sgt. Riley was placed back under the direction of those individuals whom he\u2019d had issues with in Iraq, then began to report to his wife again that he was experiencing a change back to a negative command climate and even informed her that someone had urinated on his vehicle while he was at work one day. He began driving his wife\u2019s vehicle to work when he could, as less people knew what her vehicle looked like.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>On January 24th, 2012, Sgt. Riley faced his Court Marshall hearing. In this hearing, one soldier whom Sgt. Riley had previously reprimanded, and also told he was going to prevent from going into the Special Forces due to his poor performance (he was in his squad and it was his duty to ensure that he make decisions in the best interest of the Army), testified that on June 18th 2011, Sgt. Riley entered his room in Iraq and in three separate movements, loaded his weapon asking three separate times \u201cdo you trust me?\u201d pointed it at him, commented to his roommate how red the soldier\u2019s face was and then unloaded his weapon and put it down. A second \u201cwitness\u201d who had cut his wrists in his barracks room prior to deployment, and been put on suicide watch (who never should have been in country to begin with) and needed a friend because he was mentally unsound, testified that Sgt. Riley in one swift motion walked into his room, loaded his weapon, pointed it at his subordinate, unloaded it and walked out of the room, at no time speaking\u2014the statements did not remotely add up.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The only piece of physical evidence that was entered into the courtroom by the prosecution was a letter, this letter was allegedly written by the accuser two days after the incident allegedly happened.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>In this letter, the soldier indicated that the \u201cincident\u201d had occurred and it was signed by himself and his \u201cwitness\u201d and dated June 20th 2011, and stashed away in the event that Sgt. Riley decided to \u201cmurder him and make it look like a suicide\u201d</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>There are a few flaws with this letter and these are;</p>\n<p>(1) Some of what is written in the letter contradicts what the soldier testified to.</p>\n<p>(2) The accuser testified that the letter was written and signed June 20th 2011 and stashed away for safekeeping, while the witness testified that it was written June 18th 2011 and stashed away.</p>\n<p>(3) There is no one aside from these two questionable soldiers who can arguably prove that this letter was not written at some random time and then backdated.</p>\n<p>(4) Per Article 134 of UCMJ, Paragraph 60\u2014one could argue that a letter as such, is not only inadmissible in court, but also illegal and punishable by up to 5 years in prison.</p>\n<p>(5) If the prosecution wanted to argue that the accuser was scared of Sgt. Riley, the accuser hung out with the Lieutenant who threatened Sgt. Riley\u2019s career earlier in the deployment on a regular basis, that being said\u2014he had more than enough opportunity to bring the issue to light, had it actually occurred, but chose not to (this would also indicate\u2014if the allegations were true\u2014that the soldier feared his chain of command would not address the \u201caltercation\u201d accordingly.</p>\n<p>(6) If the soldier and his roommate (the other \u201cwitness\u201d) where so in fear of Sgt. Riley, why is it then, that there is physical evidence that the roommate went to the gym on a daily basis with Sgt. Riley following the alleged incident.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Some of the other issues that were noted in the courtroom of one judge, two prosecutors, two defense attorneys, the accused and the family and friends of the accused are:</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>(1)The accused testified that he felt he was in trouble and that his family was at risk---nowhere in the alleged allegations did Sgt. Riley allegedly imply that accuser\u2019s family was at risk, thus, this would be speculation. Despite being speculation, it was allowed in court.</p>\n<p>(2) The two accusers came to court together, and left together\u2026in the same vehicle, as his wife EVEN photographed just to ensure it was noted, because the two both testified that they were not friends, had not had a chance to discuss their stories, and did not associate with one another (despite living in the same room together for their entire deployment).</p>\n<p>(3)During the Court Marshall hearing, the prosecution\u2019s attorneys had a Major sitting in the bench behind them, that was not previously approved to be a part of the prosecution team, coaching them on how to prosecute the case.</p>\n<p>(4)The testimony of the \u201ceyewitness\u201d should not have been admissible in court because prior to the deployment, said Specialist was found in his barracks room with a butcher knife cutting his wrists, had to be escorted to Womack Army Medical center, and was put on a psychological profile. (I would go as far as saying that this individual was not even fit to deploy, let alone testify in a courtroom), as this demonstrates that he is an individual with psychological issues who could be easily influenced.</p>\n<p>(5)The night before the trial, the prosecution made a phone call to the defense lead witness, and excused him from the case without proper authorization. Once the hearing began, the Judge ordered the prosecution to produce the witness, and the court was put on a recess until the witness could be produced. This was seemingly ignored by the judge, but rather childish at best.</p>\n<p>(6)Specialist \u201ceyewitness\u201d testified that he was an eyewitness to the alleged actions of Sgt. Riley against Spec. \u201cAccuser\u201d however if one carefully looked at the layout of the room in which they allege that the actions took place, one will see that based on where he claims he was sitting, there was no physical way in which he would have been able to view such actions had they of taken place.</p>\n<p>(7)The prosecution had done so poorly in the courtroom, that upon hearing the verdict, both of the prosecution attorneys showed visible shock when the Guilty verdict was read.</p>\n<p>(8)Both witnesses described Sgt. Riley as being a threat to them, they explained that they began sleeping with their weapons regularly, locking their door, and gave the impression that they lived in sheer terror, had that of been so, why is it that Spec. \u201cEyewitness\u201d went to the gym with Sgt. Riley on a daily basis after these actions allegedly occurred.</p>\n<p>(9) The prosecution explained in court that Sgt. Riley was a \u201cbad\u201d soldier because he had failed a PT test around the time that the initial allegations came out, first, this is irrelevant, as failing a PT test, does not imply that he is capable of assault, but to justify the allegation anyways, Sgt. Riley, upon returning from Iraq, had to have surgery for a tumor in his abdomen that was causing him severe pain and was ignored by his PA while deployed, and he also was given an MRI on his ankle that indicated that he had very severe damage, and he was given a profile (upon returning home from Iraq) indicating that he was physically unable to perform the duties he was prescribed.</p>\n<p>(10)The prosecution also indicated in the court room, to try and discredit his character that Sgt. Riley failed to give a class to soldiers on \u201cblood chit\u201d prior to returning home from Iraq, AGAIN, irrelevant to the case, but if one must know, this was because the chain of command had changed his subject matter without proper notice, and then forced him onto a guard duty with no proper materials to complete the task in which he was prescribed.</p>\n<p>(11)The prosecution indicated that Sgt. Riley had nothing to loose and even had made a prior statement to others that it takes a brave person to commit suicide---The FACTS with this are, while Sgt. Riley was away for training at one point in time, his best friend committed suicide, discussion about suicide is in fact a touchy subject with Sgt. Riley, not because he is not of sound mind, but because someone he loved very much had taken their own life, and he was deeply hurt by it. He has (in a way) developed a form of survivor\u2019s guilt that maybe he could address, but again it is irrelevant. The fact is, Sgt. Riley had a lot to lose, he owns his own home, has a beautiful child who absolutely adores him, and a wife who thinks the world of him.</p>\n<p>(12)The prosecution depicted Sgt. Riley as a cold and calculated individual; when truly, Sgt. Riley is quiet, mildly awkward, honest, hardworking, slightly reserved---but VERY gentle and loving. This same individual, picks up kittens on the side of the road and brings them home to bottle feed, has more patience and compassion for his child at times than his wife, shows absolute maturity---and at the end of the day was EVEN holding a position within his company that was supposed to be for a higher ranking individual than he was. He also passed two separate mental evaluations after the allegations came out (despite everything falling apart around him).</p>\n<p>(13)Sgt. Riley had no prior record, having been in the Army his ENTIRE adult life at the age of 26; Sgt. Riley has NEVER had a flaw on his record.</p>\n<p>(14) The actual Specialist \u201caccuser\u201d was previously a citizen of Brazil. He only gave up citizenship after he was unable to enter into the Special Forces Training Program, now that\u2019s okay\u2026but there\u2019s more: he is described by soldiers within the company as being a questionable individual, who seemingly is involved in some form of questionable overseas activity, he maintains offshore bank accounts (that he discussed with Sgt. Riley around tax season\u2014as he was his squad leader), has a relatively HUGE influx of unexplainable income, at the rank of E4 has no problem showing off his brand new Beemer, and purchasing items for soldiers in his company, as explained by an individual in the Company (not Sgt. Riley himself) takes phone calls (even in Iraq) at all hours of the day and night---that he claims are from a company that he owns in Brazil. This character is questionable at best.</p>\n<pre>\n(15) If the chain of command felt that Sgt. Riley was such a threat, AND the accuser and \"witness\" claim this to be true, why is it that Sgt. Riley had the entire side of the defense benches filled with soldiers sitting in on his belf, but NO ONE, and I MEAN...ABSOLUTEY, WITHOUT A DOUBT---NO ONE from Sgt. Riley's direct chain of commang had the (for lack of better words) BALLS, to come sit on the prosecution side in the court room for the trial or even the sentencing the following day, furtermore, no one showed up to support the accuser or \"witness\" as they testifed, instead...the prosecution benches had a few people present from the JAG office, and one Major who was illegally helping the prosecution team---but no one in the direct chain of command was ANYWHERE to be found throughout the trial--not only does this show a lack of concern for their own soldiers, it shows that they were too afraid to come to court, and watch their own soldier have his life ruined, see his family and newborn son, face his family, after they pushed him into the line of fire. \n</pre>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The Defense attorneys, assigned to Sgt. Riley through Trial Defense Services, did a spectacular job. One could argue that the two make a rather remarkable team, they went out of their way to truly ensure that Sgt. Riley was defended to the best of their abilities, and one could go on to say, that had anyone higher up seen the way in which they formulated the case, and acted in the courtroom, they would be impressed. Sgt. Riley\u2019s family felt that the team of two lawyers went above and beyond their duties to ensure they had their ducks in a row.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>The defense presented a few things to demonstrate Sgt. Riley\u2019s innocence, these include:</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>(1)Multiple well decorated character witnesses, all of which had previously deployed and served with, above and under Sgt. Riley. Each testified that Sgt. Riley was of sound mind; a good soldier and even that they would gladly, deploy with Sgt. Riley TODAY despite the allegations against him, and be proud to do so.</p>\n<p>(2)They also stated in court (though the conversation was not used as evidence because it depicted an argument between Sgt. Riley and his wife, along with a discussion on names of their child etc.) that during the time that the accusers allege that Sgt. Riley assaulted his accuser, Sgt. Riley was carrying on a conversation with his wife on Skype, as it was their one year Anniversary, with few absences that were all explained.</p>\n<p>(3)They produced a witness that testified that Sgt. Riley, had in fact, discussed the process for removing Specialist \u201caccuser\u2019s\u201d Special Forces packet from processing---this gives the accuser motive for why he would be so willing to fabricate a story against his squad leader.</p>\n<pre>\nUltimately, at the end of trial---the Judge stated the verdict: GUILTY. \n</pre>\n<p>Again, even the Prosecution showed shock at the verdict.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>It is VERY clear, that the burden of proof in this case, was left solely up to the defense to prove that Sgt. Riley was not in fact guilty.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>There was Absolutely NO proof that Sgt. Riley was guilty, and no solid case at all provided by the prosecution.</p>\n<pre>\nThe facts are, that the Judge took a stand and said \u201cguilty until proven innocent\u201d and that is exactly what he seems to have made his verdict based upon. \n</pre>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>FACTS:</p>\n<pre>\n(1) There was no reason for which Sgt. Riley would have commited such a stupid and childish act. \n</pre>\n<p>(2) This was one of the easiest deployments that Sgt. Riley had ever been assigned to and had he of been a cold and calculated criminal, it would have easily come to light a lot sooner than the easiest deployment he had ever been on.</p>\n<p>(3) No other subordinate has ever report Sgt. Riley to have committed any acts as such.</p>\n<p>(4) Sgt. Riley is so responsible that he will not even drive a vehicle after having one drink with dinner, how could someone with such a responsible outlook on life, make such a stupid mistake?</p>\n<p>(5) Sgt. Riley, in fact, had much to lose, a brand new infant son, a wife who he loves very much (and relies on his medical benefits for her extensive medical care---to include an upcoming heart procedure that she could be at risk of dying without, and the medications to sustain her safety until she is treated.</p>\n<p>(6) Sgt. Riley had a career that he built from nothing which he loved so dearly, with 4 past deployments under his belt, and millions of possibilities outside of the army, in the event that he chose to get out.</p>\n<p>(7) Sgt. Riley came from a small town, he did not join the army for money, or benefits, in fact, he often gave his money to his family to help support others he is related to, and very rarely even saw absolute significance in the value, so that he could help someone in need. Sgt. Riley joined the army as a true heart of hearts \u201cgood ole\u2019 boy\u201d with only the interest of the American people in mind. The rest has and always will be irrelevant to him.</p>\n<p><br/>\nOn January 25th 2012, Sgt. Riley was sentenced to: 45 days in military prison, a felony record, a misconduct discharge from the army, termination of pay/benefits.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Despite the compelling evidence that he did not commit the crime he was accused of, tonight, while you are at home with your loved ones, eating a warm meal, enjoying time at home watching your television, playing on the internet, able to kiss your children----</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Sgt. Riley is sitting in a prison cell, alone, unable to help his sick wife at home, unable to take care of and kiss his child, unable to EVER obtain a proper job again.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This man who has served almost 8 years for this country, and spent his ENTIRE adult life, doing nothing but fighting for your freedom, no longer has his reputation, career or any way to care for his family, and has lost all of the freedom he has spent his adulthood fighting for.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>His wife, has absolutely no income to pay their bills and feed their child or pets.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>This case set precedents for the Army;</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>--It says that it is okay, for a chain of command to ruin someone\u2019s career when they stood up for what was right.</p>\n<p>--it says that all of you other NCO\u2019s out there, are at risk too, because the first time that someone doesn\u2019t like YOU, they can write ONE statement saying you did whatever they want to say you did, and YOUR life too, can be ruined.</p>\n<p>--It demonstrates that the Army feels that it is perfectly alright for anyone within it\u2019s organization to violate the Constitution, human civil rights, privacy laws---and HIPPA laws.</p>\n<p><br style=\"clear:none;\"/></p>",

After all, as the likes of China and India look to meet the urgent demands of their burgeoning and increasingly ambitious workforces with jobs and a progressively middle-class lifestyle, the issue of the environment feels less immediate, and is unlikely to take centre stage. Providing access to education, housing, healthcare or even a car wins political popularity in many emerging markets- \u2018going green\u2019 has been considered a luxury.'</b></i>Bold text</p>\n<p><br/>\nBucking this trend, however, is the Philippines. Having signed the Renewable Energy Act of 2008, which paved the way for the Philippines to become a regional leader in terms of sustainable development, the country is today a leader in certain environmentally sustainable practices such as the production of geothermal energy. In addition, Filipino companies, corporations and even buildings regularly win awards at the ASEAN Conferences\u2019 Energy Efficiency Awards, held between the different South-east Asian nations, earning plaudits for their pioneering approach towards environmental sustainability. Heading up the country\u2019s Department of Energy is Secretary Jose Rene Almendras, who explains his view as to why his countrymen seem to fare so well: \u201cMy counterparts always ask me; \u201cwhat is it with you Filipinos? Why are you always winning all these awards on energy efficiency?\u201d I respond, very simply, that the cost of power in this country is very expensive.\u201d In contrast to many other countries in the region, the Philippines cannot (and will not) subsidize the country\u2019s energy costs, resulting in amongst the highest costs in the region.</p>\n<p>So, if environmental sustainability comes down to hard economics, as Secretary Almendras maintains, what can be learnt about how this issue is being dealt with in the Philippines? Will it become a model for how other emerging markets look to manage their energy demands, with those of environmental sustainability, in the future?</p>\n<p>The first and most obvious factor which is set to drive emerging markets\u2019 affinity for environmental sustainability is the cost and availability of the more traditional fossil fuels upon which governments hitherto have relied so heavily on. The price of a barrel of Brent crude rose to more than $120 by mid-February 2012, up from just over $105 a year prior. Although oil pricing does naturally tend to fluctuate, most analysts agree that the tendency in the medium-term is for prices to continue to rise. Stronger demand from Asia, geopolitical tensions coming from oil producing countries such as Iran, not to mention the unavoidable reality that oil is a finite resource with depleting reserves, all strongly indicate that many countries\u2019 energy bills are set to rise over the coming months, years and decades. With it, governments\u2019 ability to subsidize energy costs for their citizens, a common practice in many Asian countries, is set to come under extreme pressure.</p>\n<p>The Philippines is one country which doesn\u2019t subsidize its energy supply. Although this leads to higher-prices in the short-term, it is important in order to guarantee the long-term sustainability of the country\u2019s energy mix, according to Secretary Almendras: \u201cWhat happens if it costs fifteen billion dollars to subsidize your energy supply and you do not have the funds to do so? It\u2019s like in Europe, where the people have got used to certain social services which the state can no longer afford. When you look to reduce or do away with any of these social services it can cause social unrest.\u201d</p>\n<p>The other factor which should improve the attraction of environmentally sustainable practices will be technological advances. Whilst for years the world had high hopes for the potential of solar energy, it continued to be subsidized by wealthy governments who could afford it, and was never seriously considered a competitive solution to the power requirements of the world\u2019s fastest emerging economies. Fortunately things look to be changing. Thanks to technological advancements, the efficiency of solar power, in particular, has begun to make significant progress in recent years, and is now said to be approaching grid parity (the moment when the electricity solar power produces costs the same as the electricity generated by fossil fuels). By expecting that \u201chuman innovation and ingenuity will help solve the problems of today,\u201d Almendras is hoping that the latest renewable energy technologies will reach emerging markets and become competitive there in a similar way to how they have begun to do so in European markets in recent times.</p>\n<p>Is the investment on its way, which will allow these technological improvements to occur? In the case of the Philippines, the signing of a $1 billion dollar investment fund between the Qatari and Filipino governments should certainly help, as should the $1-billion fund facility will come from the Climate Investment Fund (CIF). Half of this fund, the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), provides large-scale financial resources to invest in projects and programs in developing countries, which contribute to the demonstration, deployment and transfer of low-carbon technologies.</p>\n<p>A third factor which should push emerging markets to increasingly prioritize environmentally-friendly power solutions is potentially the most powerful of all: the social element. The hundreds who perished from Typhoon Washi, which hit the southern island of Mindanao in December 2011, or the devastation caused by the 6.7 magnitude earthquake which hit the central area of the country a couple of months later, were two shocking reminders to Filipinos that they are on the front line in the battle against climate change. Despite not being a major contributor in global terms of greenhouse gas emissions, the Philippines is nonetheless one of the countries that most suffers from climate change and natural calamities. The more the country is affected, the stronger the social (and therefore political) will shall emerge to prioritize the \u2018green\u2019 agenda. In Southeast Asia, experts forecast that each economy will experience a six to seven percent average reduction in its gross domestic product in the 21st century due to the negative impact of climate change. The World Bank study titled Natural Hazards, UnNatural Disasters: The Economics of Effective Prevention, meanwhile, estimates that natural catastrophies will result in damages worth $185 billion. \u201cClimate change could then add $28-$68 billion more in damages each year from tropical cyclones alone,\u201d the study noted.</p>\n<p>The case for prioritizing the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects therefore looks set to become stronger than ever. Judging by Almendras\u2019 pledge to triple its renewable energy generation by 2030, this is an agenda which the Filipino government is already taking seriously. Former congressman and prominent businessman Renato Diaz puts it even more bluntly as he outlines his own ambitious plans to boost renewable energy generation in the Philippines: \u201cThey have the money and we have the vision\u201d. Let\u2019s hope politicians across the region put their money (and policies) where their mouth is, before it\u2019s too late.</p>\n<p><br/><br style=\"clear:none;\"/></p>",

The series results have implications for the squad composition; of the seventeen players brought into the Australian training camp running this test series, only thirteen of them can expect an opportunity to travel to London to compete in the Olympics.</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tAustralia dominated the series with precision passing from the team&#39;s goalkeepers who enabled the game to quickly move down the pool, and the ability of the team&#39;s goal scorers to get the ball on target. In contrast, through out the series, the UK lacked a quality long passing game and instead relied on short passes from the perimeter of play where they were faced with less one-on-one coverage. The last game of the series also saw several turn overs and poor shooting on the part of the UK, with many shots going above or to the side of the net, or the shot clock running out.</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tAustralia won all of the games of the test series, with scores of 13&ndash;5 in the first test last Tuesday, 14&ndash;4 in the second test last Thursday, 15&ndash;6 in the third test on Saturday, 14&ndash;8 in the fourth test yesterday (Monday) and 14&ndash;3 in the last test match today.
